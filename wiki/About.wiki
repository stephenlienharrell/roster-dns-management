===Roster Core===
Roster Core is a collection of functions to access the core API of Roster and is used heavily by Roster Server. Roster Server contains the MySQL database layer that accesses all data used by Roster. All records, zones, views, etc. are contained in the database and is the authority on any DNS data.

===Roster Server===
Roster Server is a threaded SSL enabled XML-RPC server that connects directly to Roster Core. This allows clients to run core functions remotely and securely. Users authenticate to Roster Server using LDAP or [Authentication a user supplied authentication method]. The user need not enter a password multiple times for multiple records as credentials are stored for short periods of time (See [UserToolsUsage#Credential Credentials] documentation).

===Roster User Tools===
[UserToolsUsage Roster User Tools] communicates to Roster Server. Roster User Tools contains command line tools to contact Roster Server through an SSL enabled XML-RPC client, to perform the majority of Roster tasks.

===Roster Config Manager===
[ConfigManagerUsage Roster Config Manager] is the component of Roster responsible for creating, exporting, and error checking files that will be used by BIND. Roster Config Manager contains command line tools to export all contents from the database to BIND files.
