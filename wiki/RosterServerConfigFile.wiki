#summary Details Roster Server config file

= Roster Config File =

The Roster Server config file is used by Roster Server on server startup to automatically configure a number of options. Running the roster_database_bootstrap user tools script will generate this file, leaving few modifications needed before running the Roster Server.

== Set Up ==

By running the roster_database_bootstrap script an auto-generated roster_server.conf (or whatever name was specified) file is created at the specified location. This file is world-readable and will need its file permissions changed to non-world-readable before Roster Server will start. You will also need to manually modify the *_`'server_killswitch'`_* option under the *_`[server]`_* section to be *_`'off'`_*. This will allow rosterd to start assuming other configuration values are correct.
