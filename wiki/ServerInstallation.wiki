#summary Installation of Roster Server
== Roster Server Setup ==
Installation of Roster User Tools is as follows:

  From pypi:
{{{
# easy_install RosterServer
}}}

  From source package:
{{{
# python setup.py install
}}}

== Starting Roster Server ==
The init.d script from *`roster_database_bootstrap`* will need to be configured if it needs to be autostarted on system boot. Details of this process can be found at the [InitScriptInstallation init script installation] page.

The config file generated by *`roster_database_bootstrap`* should be [CoreInstallation#Configuration configured] before running Roster Server.

If *_/etc/init.d/rosterd_* has been [InitScriptInstallation properly configured], Roster Server can be started by running 
*_
/etc/init.d/rosterd start
_*

Roster Server is now listening for commands.
